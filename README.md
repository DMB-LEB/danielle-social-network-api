# danielle-social-network-api

## Description
This challenge is the backend of a social network. Social networks need APIs, like the one seen in the repo here. These routes allow you to post thoughts, add friends, react to the thoughts posted. You can also delete thoughts, friends, and and reactions.


## Installation
      express: 4.17.1
      moment: 2.29.4
      mongoose: 6.2.1

## Usage
Though there isn't really a GUI for this, usage would be for you to stay in touch with people as you would on social networks. The purpose of this challenge is to create an API that allows you to friend others, delete friends, create thoughts, update thoughts, deleted thoughts and react to those thoughts.
